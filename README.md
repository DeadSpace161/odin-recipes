Recipes project activity

This is a simple project that will create a Recipes website.  This project will make use of several skills to include: general HTML "boilerplate" formatting (html, head, body, and other tags), the use of relative and absolute links, embedding images, working with files and folder directories, and ordered and unordered lists.
